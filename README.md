  <strong>Repository for my React NYC talk on scrollytelling.</strong>
</p>

Scrollytelling is widely used by graphics reporters, data scientists, and front-end developers, yet it can be complicated to implement, especially in React. In this talk I will give an overview of this storytelling technique, its applications, and some best practices. I will also demonstrate how to create a crude visual essay in React with a simple scrollytelling library I wrote.

Component library: [react-scrollama](https://github.com/jsonkao/react-scrollama)

## Outline

Introduce people to scrollytelling, and explain the implementation in React, subsequently introducing people the Interaction Observer and sticky positioning for further applications.
