  <strong>Repository for my React NYC talk on scrollytelling.</strong>
</p>

Scrollytelling is widely used by graphics reporters, data scientists, and front-end developers, yet it can be complicated to implement, especially in React. In this talk I will give an overview of this storytelling technique, its applications, and some best practices. I will also demonstrate how to create a crude visual essay in React with a simple scrollytelling library I wrote.

Component library: [react-scrollama](https://github.com/jsonkao/react-scrollama)

## Outline

Introduce people to scrollytelling, and explain the implementation in React, subsequently introducing people the Interaction Observer and sticky positioning for further applications.

#### What is scrollytelling?
- [a gif example]
- [short bio](https://pudding.cool/process/how-to-implement-scrollytelling/)
- Scrollytelling is a storytelling technique in which content ‚Äúunfolds‚Äù as the user scrolls.

#### Why use scrollytelling in your work?

#### How to implement scrollytelling in React: Intersection Observer API and sticky positioning
- ‚ÄúThis is experimental technology.‚Äù, and
- the shameless love child üë™ of relative and fixed
> One of the biggest implementation pains with scrollytelling is the sticky graphic pattern, whereby the graphic scrolls into view, becomes ‚Äústuck‚Äù for a duration of steps, then exits and ‚Äúunsticks‚Äù when the steps conclude.
